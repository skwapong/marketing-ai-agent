# Complete Deployment - Final Steps

## ✅ What's Already Done

All code is ready and committed to git locally.

## 🎯 What You Must Do (In Your Terminal)

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

**You will be prompted for:**
- Username: `skwapong` (just press Enter if already filled)
- Password: **[PASTE YOUR PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN HERE]**

⚠️ **Important**: The "password" is NOT your GitHub password. It's your Personal Access Token that starts with `ghp_`

### Step 2: Verify on GitHub

Once pushed, your code will be at:
**https://github.com/skwapong/marketing-ai-agent**

Open that URL in your browser to confirm.
