## **OPTION 1: Deploy via Vercel (Recommended - Easiest)**

### Step 1: Login to Vercel

In your terminal, run:
```bash
vercel login
```

Choose: **Login with GitHub** (easiest)

### Step 2: Deploy

```bash
vercel --prod --yes
```

**That's it!** You'll get:
- ✅ GitHub repo created automatically
- ✅ Live URL: `https://marketing-ai-agent.vercel.app`

## **OPTION 2: GitHub First, Then Vercel**

### Step 1: Complete GitHub Authentication

In your terminal where you ran `gh auth login`:
- Follow the prompts
- Choose: GitHub.com → HTTPS → Yes → Browser
- Authorize in browser

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

Your code is now on GitHub: `https://github.com/skwapong/marketing-ai-agent`

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

```bash
vercel login
vercel --prod --yes
```

**Time**: 5 minutes total

---

## **OPTION 3: Manual GitHub + Vercel Web Interface (No CLI)**

### For GitHub:
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Create repo: `marketing-ai-agent` (Public)
3. Get a Personal Access Token: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Name: `Marketing AI Agent`
   - Scope: `repo`
4. Push:
   ```bash
   git remote remove origin
   git remote add origin https://skwapong@github.com/skwapong/marketing-ai-agent.git
   git push -u origin main
   # Username: skwapong
   # Password: [paste token]
   ```

### For Vercel:
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/signup
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import `marketing-ai-agent`
5. Click "Deploy"

**Time**: 7-10 minutes

## 🎯 My Recommendation

**Use Option 1** - It's the fastest:

```bash
# Just run these 2 commands:
vercel login
vercel --prod --yes
```

Vercel handles everything (GitHub + deployment) in one go!
