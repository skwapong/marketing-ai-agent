# Deploy to Vercel (Easiest Method)

## ðŸš€ Deploy Now

Vercel will handle everything - GitHub repo creation AND live deployment!

### Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

### What will happen:

1. **Login prompt** - Sign in with GitHub (easiest option)
2. **Vercel connects to GitHub** - Automatically creates the repo
3. **Deploys your app** - Gets it live online
4. **Gives you a URL** - Share with colleagues immediately!

### During the prompts, choose:

```
? Set up and deploy "~/marketing-ai-agent"? [Y/n]
> Y

? Which scope do you want to deploy to?
> [Your name/account]

? Link to existing project? [y/N]
> N

? What's your project's name?
> marketing-ai-agent

? In which directory is your code located?
> ./
```

That's it! You'll get:
- âœ… GitHub repository created automatically
- âœ… Live URL: `https://marketing-ai-agent.vercel.app`
- âœ… Automatic deployments on every push

## After Deployment

You'll see output like:

```
âœ… Production: https://marketing-ai-agent-abc123.vercel.app
```

Share this URL with your colleagues!
