# GitHub Deployment Instructions

## ✅ Step 1: Git Repository (COMPLETED)

Your code is now committed to git locally!

```
✅ Git initialized
✅ All files committed
✅ Ready to push to GitHub
```

---

## 📝 Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

### Option A: Via GitHub Web Interface (Easiest)

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com/new

2. **Fill in repository details**:
   - Repository name: `marketing-ai-agent`
   - Description: `Marketing Intelligence AI Agent - AI-powered CDP analytics platform`
   - Visibility: Choose **Public** (so colleagues can view) or **Private**
   - ⚠️ **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README" (we already have one)

3. **Click "Create repository"**

4. **Copy the repository URL** (you'll see it on the next page)
   - Will look like: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/marketing-ai-agent.git`

### Option B: Via GitHub CLI (if installed)

```bash
gh repo create marketing-ai-agent --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

---

## 🚀 Step 3: Push Your Code to GitHub

Once you've created the repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/marketing-ai-agent.git

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Example**:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/samkwapong/marketing-ai-agent.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 🌐 Step 4: Deploy Options

### Option A: GitHub + Vercel (Recommended for Live Demo)

**Why?** GitHub Pages doesn't support server-side rendering (SSR) which your Next.js app uses. Vercel is the best option.

1. **Go to Vercel**: https://vercel.com/signup

2. **Sign up with GitHub** (easiest)

3. **Import your repository**:
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select `marketing-ai-agent` from your GitHub repos
   - Click "Import"

4. **Deploy**:
   - Vercel auto-detects Next.js settings
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait ~2 minutes

5. **Get your live URL**:
   - You'll get: `https://marketing-ai-agent.vercel.app`
   - Share this with colleagues!

**Benefits**:
✅ Free hosting
✅ Automatic HTTPS
✅ Global CDN
✅ Auto-deploys when you push to GitHub
✅ Perfect for Next.js

### Option B: GitHub Pages with Static Export (Limited)

⚠️ **Note**: This requires converting your app to static HTML (loses some dynamic features)

1. **Update `next.config.js`**:
```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
  },
}
```

2. **Add deployment script to `package.json`**:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "next build && touch out/.nojekyll && gh-pages -d out -t true"
  }
}
```

3. **Install gh-pages**:
```bash
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
```

4. **Deploy**:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

5. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to your repo → Settings → Pages
   - Source: Deploy from branch `gh-pages`
   - Save

**Limitations**:
⚠️ No server-side rendering
⚠️ No API routes
⚠️ Some features may not work
