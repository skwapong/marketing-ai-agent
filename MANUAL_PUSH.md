# Manual GitHub Push Instructions

Since you're running `gh auth login` in your terminal, here's what to do:

## Step 1: Complete GitHub CLI Authentication

In your terminal, you'll see prompts. Choose:

```
? What account do you want to log into?
> GitHub.com

? What is your preferred protocol for Git operations?
> HTTPS

? Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials?
> Yes

? How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI?
> Login with a web browser
```

Then:
1. Copy the one-time code shown
2. Open the browser link
3. Paste the code
4. Authorize GitHub CLI

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

Once authenticated, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/sam.kwapong/marketing-ai-agent

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

If that doesn't work, try:

```bash
# Use GitHub CLI to create and push
gh repo create marketing-ai-agent --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

---

## Alternative: Manual Web Upload

If authentication is still problematic, you can:

1. **Create the repository on GitHub**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/new
   - Name: `marketing-ai-agent`
   - Public
   - Don't initialize
   - Click "Create"

2. **Get a Personal Access Token**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Name: `Marketing AI Agent`
   - Check: `repo`
   - Generate and copy token

3. **Push with token**:
   ```bash
   git remote remove origin
   git remote add origin https://skwapong@github.com/skwapong/marketing-ai-agent.git
   git push -u origin main
   # Username: skwapong
   # Password: [paste your token]
   ```

---

## After Pushing Successfully

Your code will be at: **https://github.com/skwapong/marketing-ai-agent**

Then deploy to Vercel:
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

You'll get a live URL like: **https://marketing-ai-agent.vercel.app**

Good luck! Let me know when it's done.
